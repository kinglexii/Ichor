<h2 id="-the-genesis-of-the-rose-of-philanthropy">ðŸŒ¹ The Genesis of <em>The Rose of Philanthropy</em></h2>
<p><strong>Detailing the Sauce.</strong></p>
<p>So how did <em>The Rose of Philanthropy</em> get up and running?</p>
<p>The genesis lies in the transformative potential of a single tool I began working with  in 2019 : <strong>R</strong>.</p>
<p>At the time, I was actively discovering the open-source data ecosystemâ€”tools that were powerful,
reproducible, and adaptable.</p>
<p>R provided an easily accessible means to all of that and more. What started as a way of solving technical puzzles
quickly grew into a framework for exploring deeper questions and problem solving in food systems, public health, and environmental justice.</p>
<p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve used R across a broad spectrum of projects. Each challenge helped me unlock new approachesâ€”not just technically, but
philosophically. <em>The Rose of Philanthropy</em> was born as a way to share those discoveries and cultivate a space where technology meets ethical
data stewardship.</p>
<p>ðŸ§ª <strong>Problems I&rsquo;ve tackled with R include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Automating QA for public health and census datasets</li>
<li>Visualizing spatial disparities in food access</li>
<li>Building dashboards to support community health interventions</li>
<li>Modeling pollinator stressors and environmental risks</li>
<li>Cleaning and integrating 30+ years of taxation and development data</li>
<li>Developing pipelines to support genomics research and policy evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of <em>The Rose of Philanthropy</em> isnâ€™t just to showcase what R can doâ€”itâ€™s to <strong>build bridges</strong>: between open science and applied
equity, between code and compassion. Itâ€™s an invitation to take a <strong>learning journey</strong> with R, and to leverage data for meaningful,
reproducible impact.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for content on building your own technical pathâ€”from dashboards to spatial modeling to FAIR data frameworks. Iâ€™ll be
sharing lessons, templates, and stories to guide fellow changemakers along the way.</p>
<p>Thank you for being here. ðŸŒ±</p>

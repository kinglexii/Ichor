## ðŸŒ¹ The Genesis of *The Rose of Philanthropy*  
**Detailing the Sauce.**

So how did *The Rose of Philanthropy* get up and running? 

The genesis lies in the transformative potential of a single tool I began working with  in 2019 : **R**.

At the time, I was actively discovering the open-source data ecosystemâ€”tools that were powerful, 
reproducible, and adaptable. 

R provided an easily accessible means to all of that and more. What started as a way of solving technical puzzles 
quickly grew into a framework for exploring deeper questions and problem solving in food systems, public health, and environmental justice.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve used R across a broad spectrum of projects. Each challenge helped me unlock new approachesâ€”not just technically, but 
philosophically. *The Rose of Philanthropy* was born as a way to share those discoveries and cultivate a space where technology meets ethical 
data stewardship.

ðŸ§ª **Problems I've tackled with R include:**
- Automating QA for public health and census datasets  
- Visualizing spatial disparities in food access  
- Building dashboards to support community health interventions  
- Modeling pollinator stressors and environmental risks  
- Cleaning and integrating 30+ years of taxation and development data  
- Developing pipelines to support genomics research and policy evaluation  

The goal of *The Rose of Philanthropy* isnâ€™t just to showcase what R can doâ€”itâ€™s to **build bridges**: between open science and applied 
equity, between code and compassion. Itâ€™s an invitation to take a **learning journey** with R, and to leverage data for meaningful, 
reproducible impact.

Stay tuned for content on building your own technical pathâ€”from dashboards to spatial modeling to FAIR data frameworks. Iâ€™ll be 
sharing lessons, templates, and stories to guide fellow changemakers along the way.

Thank you for being here. ðŸŒ±

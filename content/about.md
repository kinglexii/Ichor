I am a highly motivated  [**Statistical Programmer and Consultant**](https://github.com/kinglexii) 
dedicated to detail and collaboration.  

In my previous experience, I have successfully managed, analyzed, and visualized complex healthcare and 
public health data using tools such as R, SAS, and Tableau. 

I am passionate about the computational applications of statistical analysis to create reusable data pipelines that enhance 
research reproducibility and accessibility.  


In addition to my substantive work in Data Analysis, I am interested in Mathematics, Genomics  and research methods. 

My favorite Thing to do is Crochet and I am weirdly 
evangelical about it. 


In my free time, I enjoy reading, deadlifting, swimming, and taking card games much too seriously.
